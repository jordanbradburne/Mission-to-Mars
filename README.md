# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
Build an APP to scrape data from different websites for the mission to mars projects and then create an HTML page to show the findings.

Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using Python and HTML, add the code created in Deliverable 1 to scraping.py file, update the Mongo database, and modify the index.html file so the webpage contains all the information collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
